## Why did Polarity fail?

Polarity may fail for one of the following reasons:

1. **Your original code doesn’t compile or run.**
   - Ensure the repository builds and tests pass locally. Fix baseline issues before re‑running Polarity.

2. **Your code only runs with local secrets or environment restrictions** Polarity can’t access.
   - Avoid relying on local <code>.env</code> files or machine‑specific configuration. Use safe mock values or CI‑compatible defaults.

3. **Polarity made a mistake and the Verifier can’t repair it.**
   - In this case, Polarity will not push changes to avoid breaking your codebase. Review the PR or logs, and re‑run after addressing constraints.

<Tip>
  If failures persist, open a support ticket from the navbar or attach logs to help us diagnose.

## Where can I find my API key?

To find your Polarity API key:

1. Navigate to the Polarity dashboard
2. Click on your user profile menu in the top right corner
3. Select **"Copy API Key"** from the dropdown menu

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/apikey.png" alt="Location of Copy API Key option in user dropdown menu" />
</Frame>

The API key will be copied to your clipboard and can be used for:
- Authenticating with the Polarity CLI (`pt auth login <your-api-key>`)
- Integrating with CI/CD pipelines
- Using the Polarity API directly

<Note>
  Keep your API key secure and never commit it to version control. Treat it like a password.
</Note>

## General troubleshooting

- Confirm the GitHub App is installed and has required permissions.
- Make sure the repository and branch are enabled in the dashboard.
- Re‑run the analysis after addressing compile/test errors.
