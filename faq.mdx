## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I get started with Paragon?">
    1. Install the GitHub App from the dashboard
    2. Select which repositories to monitor
    3. Enable automatic PR reviews in Settings
    4. Paragon will automatically review new pull requests

    For CLI access, install globally with `npm i -g @polarityinc/paragon` and authenticate with `paragon auth login`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where can I find my API key?">
    Your API key is located in the dashboard Settings page at the bottom. Click the copy button to copy it to your clipboard.

    Use your API key to:
    - Authenticate with the Paragon CLI (`paragon auth login`)
    - Integrate with CI/CD pipelines
    - Access the Paragon API directly

    <Warning>
      Keep your API key secure and never commit it to version control.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which repositories can Paragon access?">
    Paragon can only access repositories where:
    - The GitHub App is installed
    - You've explicitly enabled them in Settings → Automatic PR Reviews

    You control exactly which repositories Paragon monitors. Add or remove repositories anytime from the dashboard.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## PR Reviews

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why didn't Paragon review my PR?">
    Check the following:

    1. **Repository not enabled** - Ensure the repo is added in Settings → Automatic PR Reviews
    2. **Draft PR** - Draft PRs are only reviewed if "Draft PRs" is enabled in Review Options
    3. **GitHub App permissions** - The app needs read access to pull requests and code
    4. **Credit balance** - Check your remaining credits in the dashboard

    If issues persist, try disconnecting and reconnecting your GitHub account in Settings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I re-run a review?">
    To trigger a new review on an existing PR:

    1. Push a new commit to the branch
    2. Or close and reopen the PR
    3. Or use the Paragon CLI: `paragon run -q "Review this PR"`

    Each re-run consumes credits based on the PR size.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I customize what Paragon looks for?">
    Yes, you can customize reviews in several ways:

    - **Severity Filters** - Choose which severity levels to report (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
    - **Custom Rules** - Add your own coding standards and guidelines
    - **Review Options** - Enable/disable features like PR summaries, system diagrams, and commit suggestions

    All customization options are available in the dashboard Settings page.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why are there issues outside my changed lines?">
    If "Out of Diff" is enabled, Paragon analyzes surrounding code context to find issues that may be affected by your changes but aren't directly in the diff.

    To disable this, turn off "Out of Diff" in Settings → Review Options.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Paragon CLI

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I install the Paragon CLI?">
    Install globally via npm:

    ```bash
    npm i -g @polarityinc/paragon
    ```

    Then authenticate:

    ```bash
    paragon auth login
    ```

    Verify installation:

    ```bash
    paragon --version
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between paragon run and the interactive mode?">
    - **`paragon run`** - Non-interactive, single prompt execution. Great for scripts and piping.
    - **`paragon`** (no args) - Interactive terminal session with conversation history, slash commands, and model switching.

    Use `paragon run` for automation and `paragon` for exploratory coding sessions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I pipe code to Paragon?">
    Use stdin with `paragon run`:

    ```bash
    # Review a diff
    git diff | paragon run -q "Review these changes"

    # Analyze a file
    cat src/auth.ts | paragon run "Explain this code"

    # Review staged changes
    git diff --staged | paragon run -q "Check for issues"
    ```

    The `-q` flag hides the spinner for cleaner output.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Billing & Credits

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do credits work?">
    Credits are consumed when Paragon analyzes code:

    - **Automatic PR reviews** - Credits based on PR size and complexity
    - **CLI usage** - Credits based on tokens processed
    - **Context queries** - Credits for semantic search and analysis

    View your credit balance and usage statistics on the dashboard home page.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens when I run out of credits?">
    When credits are exhausted:

    - Automatic PR reviews pause until credits are replenished
    - CLI commands return an error with instructions to add credits
    - Free plan credits reset monthly
    - Paid plans can purchase additional credits anytime

    Upgrade your plan or purchase credit top-ups from the Billing page.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Paragon isn't finding issues it should catch">
    Try the following:

    1. **Enable more severity levels** - Lower severities may be filtered out
    2. **Check custom rules** - Conflicting rules may suppress findings
    3. **Enable Out of Diff** - Issues may be outside the changed lines
    4. **Increase context** - For CLI, provide more surrounding code

    If Paragon consistently misses a type of issue, add a custom rule describing what to look for.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="GitHub App connection issues">
    If you're having trouble with the GitHub connection:

    1. Go to Settings → GitHub Connection
    2. Click "Reconnect" to re-authorize
    3. Ensure you grant access to the required repositories
    4. Check that the GitHub App has the necessary permissions

    You can also reinstall the GitHub App from [github.com/apps/paragon-review](https://github.com/apps/paragon-review).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="CLI authentication errors">
    If `paragon auth login` fails:

    1. Ensure you have a valid API key from the dashboard
    2. Check your internet connection
    3. Try logging out first: `paragon auth logout`
    4. Re-authenticate: `paragon auth login`

    Run `paragon auth status` to verify your authentication state.
