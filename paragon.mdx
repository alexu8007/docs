‚úì Polarity ‚Äî Review completed with suggestions
```
A clear status indicator shows when Paragon has completed its analysis.

#### 2. Inline Code Suggestions
Paragon provides GitHub-native suggestion blocks that appear as comments on specific lines:

```diff
+ if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Request failed');
```

These suggestions can be:
- **Committed directly** using GitHub's "Commit suggestion" button
- **Batched together** using "Add suggestion to batch"
- **Reviewed and modified** before applying
