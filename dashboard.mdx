### PR Management

The dashboard displays all your pull requests in two sections:

  <Tab title="Pending PRs" icon="clock">
    View all pull requests currently being refined by Polarity AI.
    
    - Monitor refinement progress in real-time
    - See which PRs are in the queue
    - Track planner, worker, and verification status
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Finished PRs" icon="check-circle">
    Browse your completed refinements and their results.
    
    - Review optimization history
    - Compare before and after changes
    - Access refined PR links on GitHub
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Start a Refinement

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a Repository">
    Choose the repository containing the PR you want to refine
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select a Pull Request">
    Pick the specific PR from your repository that needs refinement
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click the Arrow">
