# Cursor Setup

Enable Cursor to use Paragon CLI commands by adding context to your project.

## Why Add Context?

Cursor works best when it knows what tools are available. By adding the Paragon CLI reference to your project's `.cursorrules` file, Cursor can:

- Automatically use `paragon run` for code analysis
- Pipe diffs and code through Paragon for review
- Use semantic search with `paragon context`
- Manage branches and stacks efficiently

## Setup

1. Open or create `.cursorrules` in your project root
2. Copy the CLI reference below and paste it into the file
3. Cursor will now use Paragon commands for code analysis

---

## CLI Reference

Copy the content below into your `.cursorrules` file:

```markdown
# Paragon CLI Commands

> Use Paragon CLI for enhanced code analysis, reviews, and git workflows.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Analyze code with a prompt
paragon run -q "Review this code for security issues"

# Pipe code for analysis
git diff | paragon run -q "Review these changes"
```

---

## Code Analysis Commands

### `paragon run`

Run a prompt in non-interactive mode. Accepts input via arguments or stdin.

```bash
# Basic usage
paragon run "Explain the authentication flow in this codebase"

# Quiet mode (hide spinner)
paragon run -q "Find potential bugs in the error handling"

# Feature implementation mode
paragon run --feature "Add input validation to the API endpoints"

# JSON output for structured parsing
paragon run --json "List all security issues"

# Pipe stdin
cat src/auth.go | paragon run "Explain this code"
git diff HEAD~3 | paragon run -q "Review these changes"

# Select model
paragon run -m paragon-max "Complex architectural analysis"
```

**Flags:**
| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-q, --quiet` | Hide spinner/progress output |
| `--feature` | Use feature implementation mode (vs code review) |
| `--json` | Output structured JSON findings |
| `--concise` | Results-only, no reasoning |
| `-m, --model` | Model selection (paragon-max, paragon-high, paragon-fast) |

---

### `paragon context`

Specialized context-aware queries using semantic search and AI analysis.

#### `paragon context issue`
Diagnose and find root causes of problems.

```bash
paragon context issue "Database updates not persisting"
paragon context issue "Memory leak in worker threads"
paragon context issue -q "API returning 500 errors intermittently"
```

#### `paragon context search`
Semantic code search across the codebase.

```bash
paragon context search "authentication logic"
paragon context search "where are API routes defined"
paragon context search "error handling patterns"
```

#### `paragon context knowledge`
Query project architecture and documentation.

```bash
paragon context knowledge "How does the caching layer work?"
paragon context knowledge "What's the database schema?"
paragon context knowledge "Deployment process"
```

---

## Git Workflow Commands

### `paragon submit`

Push branch and create/update GitHub PR with AI-generated description.

```bash
# AI-generated title and description
paragon submit --ai

# With custom title
paragon submit --title "Add user authentication"

# As draft PR
paragon submit --draft --ai
```

### `paragon branch create`

Create a new stacked branch with optional AI naming.

```bash
# AI-generated branch name based on changes
paragon branch create --ai

# Explicit name
paragon branch create feature/auth
```

### Stack Navigation

```bash
paragon stack      # Show branch stack tree
paragon sync       # Rebase current branch on parent
paragon next       # Move to child branch
paragon prev       # Move to parent branch
paragon top        # Jump to top of stack
paragon bottom     # Jump to bottom of stack
```

---

## Global Flags

Available on all commands:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-q, --quiet` | Hide spinners and progress output |
| `-y, --yolo` | Auto-approve all permission requests (dangerous) |
| `-d, --debug` | Enable debug logging |
| `-c, --cwd` | Set working directory |

---

## Integration Examples

### Code Review on Diff
```bash
git diff main | paragon run -q "Review for bugs and security issues"
```

### Automated PR Review
```bash
gh pr diff 123 | paragon run -q --json "Comprehensive code review"
```

### Find Root Cause
```bash
paragon context issue "Tests failing after recent merge"
```

### Pre-commit Analysis
```bash
git diff --staged | paragon run -q "Check for issues before commit"
```

### Explain Complex Code
```bash
cat src/complex-algorithm.go | paragon run "Explain this step by step"
```

---

## Output Formats

### Text Output (default)
Streaming markdown response to stdout.

### JSON Output (`--json`)
```json
{
  "issues_found": 3,
  "tasks": [
    {
      "title": "SQL Injection Risk",
      "description": "User input not sanitized in query",
      "severity": "critical",
      "file": "src/db/queries.go",
      "line": 42
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Tips

1. **Use `-q` flag** for cleaner output in scripts
2. **Pipe code via stdin** for targeted analysis
3. **Use `--json`** when parsing results programmatically
4. **Use `context issue`** for debugging problems
5. **Use `context search`** to find code patterns
```
