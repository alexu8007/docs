Once you've created tests, you can run them manually, on a schedule, or automatically when code changes.

## Run Tests Manually

### Run a Single Test

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Testing > Tests">
    Navigate to your test list
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find your test">
    Use search or filters to find the test
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Run">
    Click the play button next to the test
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Run All Tests in a Suite

Click "Run All" on any suite to execute all tests in that folder.

### Run All Tests in a Repository

From the dashboard, click "Run All Tests" to execute every test across all suites.

## View Test Results

### Test List View

The test list shows status at a glance:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 🟢 **Passed** | All assertions succeeded |
| 🔴 **Failed** | One or more assertions failed |
| 🔵 **Running** | Test is currently executing |
| ⚪ **Not Run** | Test hasn't been executed yet |
| 🟡 **Flaky** | Test passes sometimes, fails sometimes |

### Run Details

Click on any test run to see:

- **Status** - Pass/fail with duration
- **Step-by-step breakdown** - What happened at each step
- **Error messages** - Why it failed (if applicable)
- **Screenshots** - Visual snapshots (E2E tests)
- **Video recording** - Full execution replay (E2E tests)

### Step Breakdown

For E2E tests, you see each action:

```
✓ Navigate to https://myapp.com/login     (1.2s)
✓ Type "test@example.com" into #email     (0.3s)
✓ Type "password123" into #password       (0.2s)
✓ Click "Sign In" button                  (0.1s)
✓ Wait for /dashboard URL                 (2.1s)
✗ Check "Welcome" text appears            (0.5s)
  └─ Error: Expected "Welcome" but found "Error: Invalid credentials"
```

For unit/integration tests, you see the test output:

```
✓ calculateDiscount returns 0 for orders under $50
✓ calculateDiscount returns 10% for orders $50-$100
✗ calculateDiscount returns 20% for orders over $100
  └─ Expected: 80, Received: 100
✓ calculateDiscount throws for negative amounts
```

## Test Run History

Go to **Testing > Runs** to see all past test runs.

### Filters

- **Status** - Passed, Failed, Running
- **Trigger** - Manual, Scheduled, Pull Request
- **Repository** - Filter by repo
- **Search** - Find by test name

### Multi-Platform Runs

When a test runs on multiple platforms (Chrome, Firefox, Safari), they're grouped together:

```
Login Flow                    Chrome ✓  Firefox ✓  Safari ✗
├─ Chrome   Passed  (4.2s)
├─ Firefox  Passed  (5.1s)
└─ Safari   Failed  (3.8s)
```

Click to expand and see per-platform results.

## Real-Time Updates

The dashboard updates automatically:

- **Test list**: Refreshes every 3 seconds when tests are running
- **Runs page**: Refreshes every 10 seconds when tests are running
- **Dashboard**: Refreshes every 30 seconds

No need to manually refresh—status updates appear as tests complete.

## Understanding Failures

When a test fails, check:

1. **Error message** - What assertion failed?
2. **Screenshots** - What did the page look like?
3. **Previous runs** - Did this test pass before? (Regression)
4. **Other platforms** - Does it fail everywhere or just one browser?

### Common Failure Causes

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Element not found | Check if selector changed, add wait |
| Timeout | Increase timeout, check if page loads |
| Wrong text/value | Update expected value or fix bug |
| Network error | Check if API is running, add retry |
| Flaky test | Add explicit waits, make test deterministic |

## Regression Detection

Paragon automatically compares each run to previous runs. If a test that previously passed now fails, it's flagged as a regression.

You don't configure this—it happens automatically. Regressions appear highlighted in the runs list.
