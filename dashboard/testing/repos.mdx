Before you can generate or run tests, you need to add a repository to the testing dashboard.

## Add a Repository

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Testing > Repos">
    Navigate to the Testing section and click "Repos" in the sidebar
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Add Repository">
    Click the "Add Repository" button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select from GitHub">
    Choose a repository from your connected GitHub account
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Settings">
    Set the base URL and default platforms (optional)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click "Add Repository" to finish
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Repository Settings

When adding a repository, you can configure:

| Setting | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Base URL** | The URL where your app runs (for E2E tests) | `https://staging.myapp.com` |
| **Platforms** | Default browsers for E2E tests | Chrome, Firefox, Safari |
| **Environment Variables** | Secrets needed for tests (encrypted) | `API_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL` |

### Base URL

For E2E tests, Paragon needs to know where your app is running. This is typically:

- A staging/preview environment
- A local URL if running tests locally
- Your production URL (not recommended for destructive tests)

```
https://staging.myapp.com
https://preview-pr-123.myapp.com
http://localhost:3000
```

### Environment Variables

Add any secrets your tests need. These are encrypted and only decrypted when tests run.

Common examples:
- `API_KEY` - API authentication
- `TEST_USER_EMAIL` - Test account credentials
- `TEST_USER_PASSWORD` - Test account password
- `DATABASE_URL` - Database connection string

<Warning>
  Never commit secrets to your repository. Use environment variables instead.
</Warning>

### Authentication for E2E Tests

Most applications require login before testing protected pages. Configure authentication so Paragon can access authenticated areas of your app.

| Method | Description | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Credentials** | Email/password for a test account | Apps with standard login forms |
| **Session Token** | Pre-authenticated session cookie | Apps with complex auth flows |
| **OAuth** | Automated OAuth flow handling | Apps using Google, GitHub, etc. |

#### Credentials

Provide a test account email and password. Paragon logs in before each E2E test run.

```
Test Email: test@example.com
Test Password: ••••••••
Login URL: /login
```

<Tip>
  Create a dedicated test account with appropriate permissions. Avoid using real user accounts.
</Tip>

#### Session Token

For apps with MFA, SSO, or complex authentication, provide a pre-authenticated session token instead.

1. Log in to your app manually
2. Copy the session cookie from your browser
3. Paste it in the Session Token field

Paragon injects this cookie before running tests, bypassing the login flow entirely.

#### OAuth Configuration

For OAuth-based authentication (Google, GitHub, etc.), Paragon can automate the OAuth flow:

1. Select the OAuth provider
2. Enter test account credentials for that provider
3. Paragon handles the redirect flow automatically

<Note>
  OAuth credentials are encrypted and only used during test execution.
</Note>

### Automatic Test Triggers

Configure when tests run automatically for this repository.

| Trigger | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Run on Pull Request** | Run tests when a PR is opened or updated | Enabled |
| **Run on Push to Production** | Run tests when code is pushed or merged to production | Disabled |

#### Run on Pull Request

When enabled, tests automatically run whenever:

- A new pull request is opened
- New commits are pushed to an existing PR
- A PR is reopened

Results appear as a GitHub check on the PR, blocking merge if tests fail (when configured as a required check).

#### Run on Push to Production

When enabled, tests run whenever code is pushed or merged to your production branch.

1. Enable the "Run on Push to Production" toggle
2. Select your production branch from the dropdown (e.g., `main`, `master`, `production`)
3. Tests run automatically after each push or merge to that branch

<Tip>
  Use this to catch issues that slip through PR reviews or to verify the final merged state.
</Tip>

#### Per-Suite Triggers

Control which test suites run for each trigger. When you enable triggers, a table appears letting you select which suites run on PR vs. push:

| Suite | Run on PR | Run on Push |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Authentication | ✓ | ✓ |
| Checkout Flow | ✓ | ✓ |
| Performance | ✗ | ✓ |

This lets you run fast tests on every PR while reserving slower tests for post-merge.

## Auto-Detection

When you add a repository, Paragon scans it to detect:

- **Existing test files** - Tests you've already written
- **Test framework** - vitest, jest, pytest, etc.
- **Project structure** - Where source code and tests live

This helps Paragon generate tests that match your existing setup.

## Repository Health

After running tests, you'll see a health indicator for each repository:

- **Green** - All tests passing
- **Yellow** - Some tests skipped or flaky
- **Red** - Failing tests

The health bar on the dashboard shows the ratio of passing to failing tests at a glance.

## Managing Repositories

### Edit Settings

Click on a repository to update its base URL, platforms, or environment variables.

### Remove Repository

Click the delete button to remove a repository. This removes all tests and run history for that repository.

<Note>
  Removing a repository from the testing dashboard does not affect your actual GitHub repository.
