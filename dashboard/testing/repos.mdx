Before you can generate or run tests, you need to add a repository to the testing dashboard.

## Add a Repository

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Testing > Repos">
    Navigate to the Testing section and click "Repos" in the sidebar
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Add Repository">
    Click the "Add Repository" button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select from GitHub">
    Choose a repository from your connected GitHub account
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Settings">
    Set the base URL and default platforms (optional)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click "Add Repository" to finish
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Repository Settings

When adding a repository, you can configure:

| Setting | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Base URL** | The URL where your app runs (for E2E tests) | `https://staging.myapp.com` |
| **Platforms** | Default browsers for E2E tests | Chrome, Firefox, Safari |
| **Environment Variables** | Secrets needed for tests (encrypted) | `API_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL` |

### Base URL

For E2E tests, Paragon needs to know where your app is running. This is typically:

- A staging/preview environment
- A local URL if running tests locally
- Your production URL (not recommended for destructive tests)

```
https://staging.myapp.com
https://preview-pr-123.myapp.com
http://localhost:3000
```

### Environment Variables

Add any secrets your tests need. These are encrypted and only decrypted when tests run.

Common examples:
- `API_KEY` - API authentication
- `TEST_USER_EMAIL` - Test account credentials
- `TEST_USER_PASSWORD` - Test account password
- `DATABASE_URL` - Database connection string

<Warning>
  Never commit secrets to your repository. Use environment variables instead.
</Warning>

## Auto-Detection

When you add a repository, Paragon scans it to detect:

- **Existing test files** - Tests you've already written
- **Test framework** - vitest, jest, pytest, etc.
- **Project structure** - Where source code and tests live

This helps Paragon generate tests that match your existing setup.

## Repository Health

After running tests, you'll see a health indicator for each repository:

- **Green** - All tests passing
- **Yellow** - Some tests skipped or flaky
- **Red** - Failing tests

The health bar on the dashboard shows the ratio of passing to failing tests at a glance.

## Managing Repositories

### Edit Settings

Click on a repository to update its base URL, platforms, or environment variables.

### Remove Repository

Click the delete button to remove a repository. This removes all tests and run history for that repository.

<Note>
  Removing a repository from the testing dashboard does not affect your actual GitHub repository.
