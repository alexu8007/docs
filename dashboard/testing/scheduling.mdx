Every hour:               0 * * * *
```

### What to Include

You can schedule:

- **All tests** in a repository
- **A specific suite** (e.g., just "Authentication" tests)
- **Individual tests** (e.g., just the critical checkout flow)

## Managing Schedules

### View All Schedules

The calendar view shows all scheduled runs:

- Blue dots indicate days with scheduled tests
- Click a day to see what's scheduled
- Hover for quick details

### Edit a Schedule

Click on any schedule to:

- Change the frequency
- Add or remove tests
- Update the time

### Pause a Schedule

Toggle the schedule on/off without deleting it. Useful for:

- Maintenance windows
- Temporarily disabling while fixing failures
- Holiday periods

### Delete a Schedule

Remove a schedule entirely. This doesn't delete the tests, just stops automatic runs.

## Notifications

Get notified when scheduled tests complete:

### Enable Notifications

Go to **Testing > Settings** and configure:

| Notification | When It Fires |
|--------------|---------------|
| **On Failure** | Any test fails |
| **On Flaky** | A test is marked flaky |
| **On Success** | All tests pass (optional) |
| **Suite Complete** | When all scheduled tests finish |

### Notification Channels

Configure integrations in **Settings > Alerts** to receive notifications:

| Channel | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Email** | Send alerts directly to any email address |
| **Slack** | Post to a Slack channel via incoming webhook |
| **Discord** | Post to a Discord channel via webhook |
| **Microsoft Teams** | Post to a Teams channel via connector webhook |

#### Setting Up Integrations

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Settings > Alerts">
    Navigate to the alert settings page
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Add Integration">
    Select your preferred platform
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Webhook">
    For Slack/Discord/Teams, paste your webhook URL. For email, enter the recipient address.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the Integration">
    Click "Test" to verify the connection works
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  You can add multiple integrations. For example, send critical failures to Slack and a summary email to the team lead.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

### When to Schedule

| Scenario | Recommended Schedule |
|----------|---------------------|
| Smoke tests | Every 6 hours |
| Full test suite | Daily (overnight) |
| Critical flows | Every hour |
| Performance tests | Weekly |

### Tips

<Tip>
  Schedule tests during off-peak hours to avoid impacting staging environments.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Start with daily runs, then increase frequency for critical tests after you have confidence in stability.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Don't schedule tests against production if they create test data or make destructive changes.
</Warning>

## Viewing Scheduled Run Results

Scheduled runs appear in **Testing > Runs** with trigger type "Scheduled".

Filter by trigger to see only scheduled runs:

1. Go to Testing > Runs
2. Click the Trigger filter
3. Select "Scheduled"
