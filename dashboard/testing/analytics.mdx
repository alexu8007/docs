The analytics dashboard gives you visibility into your testing health across all repositories.

## Dashboard Stats

The main testing dashboard shows four key metrics:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total Tests** | Number of tests across all repositories |
| **Pass Rate** | Percentage of tests passing |
| **Hours Saved** | Estimated manual testing time saved |
| **Flaky Tests** | Tests that pass sometimes, fail sometimes |

## Repository Health

The health visualization shows each repository as a bar:

```
my-frontend    ████████████░░░░  75% passing
my-backend     ████████████████  100% passing
my-api         ████░░░░░░░░░░░░  25% passing
```

- **Green** = Passing tests
- **Red** = Failing tests
- **Gray** = Tests not run

Click any repository to drill down into its test details.

## Pass Rate Trends

Track how your pass rate changes over time:

- Daily pass rate percentage
- Week-over-week comparison
- Identify when regressions were introduced

## Flaky Test Detection

A test is marked **flaky** when it:

- Passes on some runs, fails on others
- Has inconsistent results without code changes

### Why Flaky Tests Matter

Flaky tests:
- Waste time investigating false failures
- Reduce trust in your test suite
- Slow down development

### Fixing Flaky Tests

Common causes and solutions:

| Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Race conditions | Add explicit waits |
| Shared state | Isolate test data |
| Network timing | Mock external APIs |
| Animation timing | Wait for animations to complete |
| Random data | Use deterministic test data |

## Test Duration

See which tests are slow:

- Average duration per test
- Duration trends over time
- Identify tests that have gotten slower

Slow tests increase feedback time and CI costs.

## Run History

View aggregated statistics:

- Total runs this week/month
- Runs by trigger type (Manual, Scheduled, PR)
- Runs by platform (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

## Filtering Analytics

Filter analytics by:

- **Repository** - Focus on one repo
- **Time range** - Last 7 days, 30 days, 90 days
- **Test type** - Unit, Integration, E2E

## Exporting Data

Export analytics for reporting:

1. Go to Testing > Analytics
2. Set your filters
3. Click Export
4. Download as CSV

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  Review flaky tests weekly. A few flaky tests can erode trust in your entire suite.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Watch for pass rate drops after deployments—they indicate regressions.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Keep E2E tests under 30 seconds when possible. Long tests are more likely to be flaky.
</Tip>
