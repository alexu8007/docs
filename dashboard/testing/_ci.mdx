Paragon integrates with GitHub to run tests automatically when code changes.

## How It Works

```
Developer opens PR → GitHub sends webhook → Paragon runs tests → Results posted to PR
```

No CI configuration files needed. Paragon handles everything.

## Enable GitHub Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install GitHub App">
    Install the [Paragon GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/paragon-review/installations/select_target) on your repository
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Repository">
    Add the repository in Testing > Repos
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Triggers">
    Turn on "Run on PR" and/or "Run on Push" in repository settings
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Trigger Options

Configure when tests run automatically:

| Trigger | When It Runs | Use Case |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Run on PR** | When a pull request is opened or updated | Catch issues before merge |
| **Run on Push** | When code is pushed to main/master | Verify production branch |

### Run on PR

Tests run when:
- A new PR is opened
- New commits are pushed to a PR
- A PR is reopened

Results appear as a GitHub check on the PR.

### Run on Push

Tests run when:
- Code is pushed directly to main/master
- A PR is merged

Use this to verify nothing broke after merge.

## GitHub Check Results

When tests run on a PR, results appear as a GitHub check:

```
✓ Paragon Tests — All 12 tests passed
```

Or if something fails:

```
✗ Paragon Tests — 2 of 12 tests failed
```

Click "Details" to see:
- Which tests failed
- Error messages
- Screenshots (for E2E tests)
- Link to full results in dashboard

## PR Comments

Optionally, Paragon can post a comment on your PR with a summary:

```markdown
## Test Results

✓ 10 passed
✗ 2 failed

### Failures
- Login flow: Expected "Welcome" but found "Error"
- Checkout: Timeout waiting for payment form

```

Enable PR comments in Testing > Settings.

## Status Checks

Configure Paragon as a required status check to block merges when tests fail:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to GitHub repo settings">
    Settings > Branches > Branch protection rules
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit your main branch rule">
    Click "Edit" on the main/master protection rule
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable status checks">
    Check "Require status checks to pass before merging"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Paragon">
    Search for "Paragon Tests" and select it
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click "Save changes"
  </Step>
</Steps>

Now PRs cannot be merged until Paragon tests pass.

## Preview Environments

For E2E tests, you need a running app to test against. Options:

### Static Base URL

Set a fixed URL in repository settings:

```
https://staging.myapp.com
```

All E2E tests run against this URL.

### Dynamic Preview URLs

If you use Vercel, Netlify, or similar:

1. Paragon detects the preview URL from the deployment
2. Tests automatically run against the preview environment
3. Each PR tests its own isolated preview

<Tip>
  Dynamic preview URLs are ideal—they test the exact code in the PR, not staging.
</Tip>

## Webhook Configuration

The GitHub App handles webhooks automatically. No manual configuration needed.

If you need a custom webhook URL (for CI/CD pipelines):

1. Go to Testing > Settings
2. Copy the webhook URL
3. Add it to your CI configuration

Example for GitHub Actions:

```yaml
- name: Trigger Paragon Tests
  run: |
    curl -X POST https://api.polarity.cc/api/test/webhook/github \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.PARAGON_API_KEY }}" \
      -d '{"repository": "${{ github.repository }}", "sha": "${{ github.sha }}"}'
```

## Viewing PR Test Runs

PR-triggered runs appear in Testing > Runs with:

- Trigger type: "Pull Request"
- PR number and title
- Commit SHA
- Link to the PR

Filter by trigger type to see only PR runs.

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  Start with "Run on PR" only. Add "Run on Push" once your tests are stable.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Keep PR tests fast (under 5 minutes). Move slow tests to scheduled runs.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Use preview environments for E2E tests so each PR tests in isolation.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Don't run destructive tests against shared staging environments on every PR—tests may interfere with each other.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### Tests not running on PR

1. Check GitHub App is installed on the repository
2. Verify "Run on PR" is enabled in repository settings
3. Check webhook delivery in GitHub (Settings > Webhooks > Recent Deliveries)

### Wrong environment being tested

1. Check base URL in repository settings
2. For preview environments, verify deployment is complete before tests start
3. Check environment variables are set correctly

### Status check not appearing

1. Run tests manually once to register the check
2. Ensure repository is added in Testing > Repos
3. Check GitHub App permissions include "Checks" write access
