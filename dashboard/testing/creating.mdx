Paragon generates test code from natural language descriptions. Tell it what to test, and it writes the code.

## Create a New Test

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Testing > Tests">
    Navigate to the Testing section and click "Tests"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click New Test">
    Click the "Add Test" button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Repository">
    Choose which repository this test is for
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Test Type">
    Select Unit, Integration, or E2E
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe Your Test">
    Enter a prompt describing what to test
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate & Save">
    Click Generate, review the code, then Save
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Writing Good Prompts

The better your prompt, the better the generated test.

### Unit Test Prompts

Be specific about the function and expected behavior:

<CodeGroup>
```text Good
Test the calculateDiscount function:
- Returns 0 for orders under $50
- Returns 10% off for orders $50-$100
- Returns 20% off for orders over $100
- Throws error for negative amounts
```

```text Bad
Test the discount function
```
</CodeGroup>

### Integration Test Prompts

Specify the endpoint, inputs, and expected outputs:

<CodeGroup>
```text Good
Test POST /api/users/register:
- Returns 201 and user object for valid email/password
- Returns 400 for invalid email format
- Returns 409 if email already exists
- Password is not included in response
```

```text Bad
Test the register API
```
</CodeGroup>

### E2E Test Prompts

Describe the user journey step by step:

<CodeGroup>
```text Good
Test the checkout flow:
1. Go to /products
2. Click "Add to Cart" on the first product
3. Click the cart icon
4. Click "Checkout"
5. Fill in shipping address
6. Enter test credit card 4242424242424242
7. Click "Place Order"
8. Verify order confirmation page shows
```

```text Bad
Test checkout works
```
</CodeGroup>

## Test Organization

Tests are organized into **Suites** (folders) within each repository.

```
Repository: my-app
├── Suite: Authentication
│   ├── Test: Login flow
│   ├── Test: Registration
│   └── Test: Password reset
├── Suite: Checkout
│   ├── Test: Add to cart
│   └── Test: Payment processing
└── Suite: API
    ├── Test: GET /api/users
    └── Test: POST /api/orders
```

When creating a test, you can:
- Add it to an existing suite
- Create a new suite

## Choosing a Framework

For unit and integration tests, select your test framework:

| Language | Frameworks |
|----------|------------|
| JavaScript/TypeScript | vitest, jest, mocha |
| Python | pytest, unittest |
| Go | go test |
| Rust | cargo test |

Paragon auto-detects your framework from `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, etc. You can override if needed.

## Choosing Platforms (E2E Only)

For E2E tests, select which browsers to run on:

- **Chrome** - Most common, fastest
- **Firefox** - Good for cross-browser testing
- **Safari** - Required for macOS/iOS compatibility
- **Mobile** - Mobile viewport simulation

You can select multiple platforms. Each platform runs as a separate job.

## Import Existing Tests

Already have tests? Import them instead of generating new ones:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Import tab">
    In the new test dialog, click "Import"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select test file">
    Browse your repository and select an existing test file
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    The test is added to your dashboard for tracking
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Auto-Detect Tests

Let Paragon scan your repository and find all existing tests:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Auto-Detect tab">
    In the new test dialog, click "Auto-Detect"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run scan">
    Paragon analyzes your repository structure
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review results">
    See all detected test files and frameworks
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import selected">
    Choose which tests to add to the dashboard
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Editing Tests

Click any test to edit it:

- Update the test name or description
- Regenerate code with a new prompt
- Change platforms (E2E)
- Move to a different suite
