### Review Options

Configure what to include in automatic PR reviews:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Out of Diff">
    Find issues beyond the changed lines. When enabled, Paragon analyzes surrounding code context to catch issues that may be affected by your changes but aren't in the diff itself.

    **Example:** You modify a function's return type. Paragon flags callers of that function elsewhere in the file that may now have type mismatches.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Commit Suggestions">
    One-click commit fixes directly from the PR. Paragon provides actionable code suggestions that you can apply instantly without leaving GitHub.

    **Example:** Paragon detects a missing null check and offers a "Commit suggestion" button that adds `if (user == null) return;` with a single click.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Code Diffs">
    Show inline diffs for suggestions. Instead of just describing the fix, Paragon displays a visual before/after diff so you can see exactly what changes are proposed.

    **Example:**
    ```diff
    - const data = response.data
    + const data = response.data ?? []
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="PR Summary">
    Generate an overview of review findings at the top of the PR. Provides a high-level summary including issue counts by severity, key concerns, and overall assessment.

    **Example:** "This PR adds user authentication. Found 2 high-severity issues (SQL injection risk, missing rate limiting) and 3 medium-severity suggestions."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Summary Splitting">
    Split the PR summary and detailed review into 2 separate comments. Useful for large PRs where you want the overview separate from line-by-line feedback.

    **Example:** First comment contains the executive summary and issue counts. Second comment contains all inline code review comments.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Draft PRs">
    Review draft pull requests. When enabled, Paragon runs automatic reviews on PRs marked as drafts, giving you early feedback before the PR is ready for human review.

    **Example:** You open a draft PR for a new feature. Paragon immediately reviews it and catches a security issue before you've even requested review from teammates.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="System Diagram">
    Generate an architecture flow diagram showing how the changed code fits into the system. Visualizes data flow, component relationships, and integration points.

    **Example:** For a PR modifying an API endpoint, Paragon generates a Mermaid diagram showing: Client → API Gateway → Auth Middleware → Your Endpoint → Database.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Severity Filters

Control which types of issues are reported in your PR reviews.

### Issue Severity Levels

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Critical" icon="circle-exclamation" color="#dc2626">
    Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks, crash-causing bugs
  </Card>
  <Card title="High" icon="triangle-exclamation" color="#ea580c">
    Major bugs, significant performance issues
  </Card>
  <Card title="Medium" icon="circle-info" color="#ca8a04">
    Code quality issues, best practice violations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Low" icon="lightbulb" color="#16a34a">
    Style issues, minor improvements, suggestions
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Additional Filters

| Filter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Out of Diff** | Include issues found outside the changed lines |
| **PR Summary** | Generate a summary of analysis findings |
| **System Diagram** | Generate architecture visualization (requires PR Summary) |

<Note>
  At least one severity filter must remain enabled.
</Note>
