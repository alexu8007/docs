## Trigger Reviews Manually

You can trigger a PR review on-demand by tagging `@paragon-review` in any comment on a pull request. This is useful when:

- You want to re-run a review after making changes
- The repository doesn't have automatic reviews enabled
- You want a review on a specific PR without enabling auto-reviews

<Note>
Simply comment `@paragon-review` on any open pull request to trigger an AI-powered code review.
