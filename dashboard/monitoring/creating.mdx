description: "Add infrastructure monitors and uptime checks."
---

The Monitoring page has two tabs: **Infrastructure** for AI-powered scans and **Uptime** for URL health checks.

## Infrastructure Monitors

Infrastructure monitors run AI prompts on a schedule to scan your cloud services, code, and dependencies.

### Create from Template

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Monitoring">
    Navigate to the Monitoring page
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Add Monitor">
    Click the "+" button to add a new monitor
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a Template">
    Choose from AWS Security, Cost Optimization, Code Quality, etc.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Cadence">
    Select Hourly, Daily, or Weekly
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click Create to start the monitor
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Available Templates

| Template | What It Does |
|----------|--------------|
| **AWS Security Scan** | Scans for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in AWS |
| **Exposed S3 Buckets** | Finds publicly accessible S3 buckets |
| **Cost Optimization** | Identifies unused EC2 instances and savings opportunities |
| **Terraform Drift** | Detects differences between Terraform state and actual infrastructure |
| **Code Quality** | Analyzes code for anti-patterns, bugs, and issues |
| **Dependency Scan** | Checks for vulnerable or outdated packages |
| **README Sync** | Keeps README.md updated with codebase changes |

### Custom Prompts

Create a monitor with any prompt:

1. Click "Add Monitor"
2. Select "Custom" instead of a template
3. Write your prompt describing what to check
4. Select cadence and save

Example prompts:
```
Check my Vercel deployments for failed builds
Scan for hardcoded API keys in the codebase
Audit IAM permissions for overly permissive policies
```

### Repository Selection

Some monitors analyze code and require a repository:

- **Code Quality** - requires repository
- **Dependency Scan** - requires repository
- **README Sync** - requires repository

Select the repository from the dropdown when creating these monitors.

### Run Now

To run a monitor immediately instead of waiting for the schedule:

1. Find the monitor in the list
2. Click the refresh icon
3. Results appear in the detail panel

## Uptime Monitors

Uptime monitors check if URLs are responding.

### Create an Uptime Monitor

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Monitoring → Uptime tab">
    Switch to the Uptime tab
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Add URL Monitor">
    Click the "+" button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Details">
    Add name, URL, and check interval
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Alerts (Optional)">
    Select which integrations receive alerts
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click Create to start monitoring
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Configuration Options

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | Display name for the monitor |
| **URL** | The URL to check (https:// added automatically) |
| **Interval** | How often to check (30s, 60s, 5min, etc.) |
| **Alert Integrations** | Which channels receive down alerts |

### Check Now

Click the refresh icon on any uptime monitor to run an immediate check. The result shows:

- **Status** - Up or Down
- **Latency** - Response time in milliseconds

## Managing Monitors

### Enable/Disable

Toggle monitors on or off without deleting them. Disabled monitors don't run but keep their configuration.

### Delete

Click the trash icon to permanently remove a monitor.

### View Results

Click any infrastructure monitor to see:

- **Last run time** and duration
- **Output summary** from the AI
- **Findings** with severity levels
- **Full output** in markdown format
