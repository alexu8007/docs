### Getting Webhook URLs

| Platform | How to Get Webhook URL |
|----------|------------------------|
| **Slack** | Apps → Incoming Webhooks → Add to Slack |
| **Discord** | Server Settings → Integrations → Webhooks → New Webhook |
| **Teams** | Channel → Connectors → Incoming Webhook |

### Managing Integrations

- **Enable/Disable** - Toggle integrations on or off
- **Test** - Send a test message to verify it works
- **Delete** - Remove integrations you no longer need

## Alert Thresholds

Choose which severity levels trigger alerts:

| Severity | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Critical** | Immediate security threats | Enabled |
| **High** | Important issues requiring attention | Enabled |
| **Medium** | Moderate issues to review | Disabled |
| **Low** | Minor issues and recommendations | Disabled |

Configure thresholds in **Monitoring → Alerts**.

<Note>
  Even with thresholds disabled, all findings still appear in the Findings page—they just won't trigger alerts.
</Note>

## Uptime Alerts

Uptime monitors can send alerts to specific integrations when URLs go down.

### Configure per Monitor

When creating or editing an uptime monitor:

1. Click the monitor to open settings
2. Select which integrations should receive alerts
3. Save changes

This lets you route different monitors to different channels (e.g., production alerts to PagerDuty, staging alerts to Slack).

## Findings

View all findings from infrastructure monitors in **Monitoring → Findings**.

### Finding Details

Each finding includes:

- **Title** - What was detected
- **Description** - Details about the issue
- **Severity** - Critical, High, Medium, or Low
- **Resource** - Which resource is affected
- **Remediation** - How to fix it
- **Monitor** - Which monitor detected it

### Managing Findings

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Open** | Needs attention |
| **In Progress** | Being worked on |
| **Resolved** | Issue fixed |
| **Ignored** | Not applicable |

Click a finding to change its status or view full details.

### Clear Findings

To clear all findings:

1. Go to Monitoring → Findings
2. Click "Clear All"
3. Confirm the action

<Warning>
  Clearing findings is permanent and cannot be undone.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  Start with Critical and High alerts enabled. Add Medium alerts once you've addressed the urgent issues.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Use separate Slack channels for different severity levels to avoid alert fatigue.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Test your integrations regularly to ensure webhooks haven't expired.
