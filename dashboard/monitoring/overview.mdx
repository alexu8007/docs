Paragon Monitoring provides two types of automated checks: AI-powered infrastructure monitors that scan for security issues and code quality, and uptime monitors that track service availability.

## Monitor Types

## Infrastructure Monitors

Run AI prompts on a schedule to scan your infrastructure and code:

| Template | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **AWS Security Scan** | Scan for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities |
| **Exposed S3 Buckets** | Find publicly accessible buckets |
| **Cost Optimization** | Identify unused resources and savings |
| **Terraform Drift** | Detect state vs actual config drift |
| **Code Quality** | Check for anti-patterns and issues |
| **Dependency Scan** | Find outdated or vulnerable packages |
| **README Sync** | Keep README updated with codebase changes |

Infrastructure monitors connect to your cloud services via MCP integrations (AWS, GCP, Vercel, Supabase, etc.).

### Cadence Options

| Cadence | When It Runs |
|---------|--------------|
| **Hourly** | Every hour |
| **Daily** | Once per day |
| **Weekly** | Once per week |

## Uptime Monitors

Track whether your URLs are responding:

- Add any URL (websites, APIs, health endpoints)
- Set check interval (30s, 60s, 5min, etc.)
- Get alerted when services go down
- Track response latency over time

### Status Indicators

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Up** | URL responding successfully |
| **Down** | URL not responding or returning errors |
| **Unknown** | Not yet checked |

## Findings

When infrastructure monitors detect issues, they create findings with severity levels:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Critical" icon="circle-exclamation">
    Immediate security threats requiring urgent action
  </Card>
  <Card title="High" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Important issues requiring attention
  </Card>
  <Card title="Medium" icon="circle-info">
    Moderate issues to review
  </Card>
  <Card title="Low" icon="lightbulb">
    Minor issues and recommendations
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Findings can be marked as:
- **Open** - Needs attention
- **In Progress** - Being worked on
- **Resolved** - Fixed
- **Ignored** - Not applicable

## Dashboard

The Monitoring dashboard shows:

- **Service Health %** - Percentage of healthy monitors
- **Needs Attention %** - Monitors with issues
- **Active Monitors** - Total monitors running
- **Health trend chart** - Historical view by day/week/month
