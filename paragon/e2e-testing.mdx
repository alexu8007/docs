description: "Generate and run end-to-end tests using natural language."

Paragon generates and runs Playwright tests from plain English. Describe what you want to test, and Paragon handles the rest.

## Quick Start

Just tell Paragon what to test:

```
Test the checkout flow with an expired credit card
```

Paragon writes the Playwright test, runs it, and opens an HTML report with video recordings and tracing so you can see exactly what happened.

## How It Works

1. **Describe the test** in natural language
2. **Paragon generates** Playwright tests and saves a scenario to `paragon.json`
3. **View results** with video recordings, tracing, and screenshots

<Tip>
Tests run on your actual machine with your real environment variables, secrets, and local services.

## Running Saved Tests

Once a scenario is saved, run it anytime:

| Method | How |
|--------|-----|
| **CLI** | `paragon tests run <scenario-id>` |
| **Chat** | "run my e2e tests" |
| **TUI** | `ctrl+p` → Automation Scenarios |
