# Configuration

## paragon.json

Create a `paragon.json` file in your project root to configure Paragon behavior:

```json
{
  "automations": [
    {
      "name": "Build & Test",
      "prompts": [
        "Run the build",
        "Run all tests",
        "Report any failures"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## PARAGON.md

Use `/init` to generate a `PARAGON.md` file that provides project context to Paragon. This file should contain:

- Project structure overview
- Key technologies and frameworks
- Development conventions
- Important architectural decisions

## Authentication

### Login

```bash
paragon auth login
```

Opens a browser-based authentication flow to connect your Paragon account.

### Status

```bash
paragon auth status
```

Displays current authentication state and account information.

### Logout

```bash
paragon auth logout
```

Removes stored credentials.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How do I switch models mid-conversation?">
Use the `/model` command to open the model picker and select a different model. Your conversation context is preserved.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the difference between sessions and compact?">
Sessions are separate conversations with independent context. `/compact` summarizes your current session and starts fresh with that summary as context.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do MCP servers work?">
MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers extend Paragon's capabilities by connecting to external tools and services. Configure them via `/mcp` to give Paragon access to filesystems, databases, APIs, and more.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is yolo mode safe to use?">
Yolo mode (`/approvals`) auto-approves all tool executions. Use it only when you trust the operations being performed and want faster iteration. You can toggle it off at any time.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do monitors work?">
Monitors are scheduled tasks that run Paragon prompts at regular intervals. They require Polarity authentication and run in the background based on your configured cadence.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use Paragon offline?">
Paragon requires an internet connection to communicate with AI models. Some MCP servers may work offline if they only access local resources.
