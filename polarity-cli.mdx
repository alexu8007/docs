## Introduction
Polarity CLI (`pt`) is a Git-based workflow assistant designed to make stacked pull request development ergonomic, predictable, and fast. The CLI layers a rich metadata, automation, and UX experience over your existing Git repository and GitHub remote. It focuses on:

- Keeping pull requests small, comprehensible, and easy to review by encouraging stacked branching.
- Automating repetitive tasks like restacking, submitting PRs, updating PR descriptions, and cleaning up after merges.
- Providing safe escape hatches (rewind, unrewind, undo) and clear status reporting to help you recover quickly when something goes wrong.
- Integrating tightly with GitHub (via the `gh` CLI) and Polarity's API for authentication, analytics, and AI-powered helpers.

If you have never used Polarity before, this guide walks through everything you need: how the CLI is structured, how to authenticate, how to run core workflows, and what each command does. The goal is to enable you to manage your entire development life cycle—branch creation, stacked PRs, reviews, landing, and cleanup—without leaving the terminal.

---

## System Requirements & Dependencies
Before installing Polarity CLI, verify your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System**: macOS, Linux, or Windows (WSL2 recommended). The CLI depends on standard POSIX Git tooling.

---

## Installation & First-Time Setup
Follow these steps to install and configure the CLI locally:

1. **Download the package**

   ```bash
   brew install polarityinc/polarity/polarity
   ```

2. **Authenticate with polarity**

   ```bash
   pt auth
   ```

  you need to have gh installed, you can install it with brew install gh

3. **Your done! Look into Polarity commands by typing in pt help**:

---

## Authentication & Accounts
Authentication happens on two fronts: GitHub and Polarity.

### GitHub Authentication
Polarity CLI relies on the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for operations like viewing, editing, and merging pull requests.

1. Install GH CLI if not already present.
2. Run `pt auth` to trigger the GitHub authentication flow. The CLI will:
   - Check your `gh` version.
   - Prompt you through `gh auth login` (with logout retry if necessary).
   - Confirm that Polarity has the permissions it needs.

### Polarity Authentication (API Token)
Some features—particularly AI operations, repository monitoring (`pt add`), and analytics—require a Polarity API token.

1. Visit [Dashboard](https://home.polarity.cc/dashboard) (or the updated domain) and generate an API key.
2. Run `pt auth login` (found under `pt auth login <token>` in the `auth-commands`) to store the token securely under `~/.polarity/auth.json`.
3. After successful login, `pt auth status` shows the stored account and plan.
4. To log out, run `pt auth logout`.

The stored token is used automatically for API operations (e.g. AI features; repository sync via Supabase; analytics).

---

## Core Concepts
Understanding Polarity’s mental model will help every command make more sense.

### Stack
A **stack** is an ordered chain of branches/pull requests. Each branch builds on its parent to form an incremental story. Example:

```
main <- feat/api <- feat/frontend <- docs/update
```

This stack contains three dependent branches, ending in `docs/update`.

### Trunk
The **trunk** is your base branch: usually `main` or `master`. Polarity records the trunk name in `.graphite_repo_config`. Commands like `pt restack`, `pt submit`, and `pt merge` compare branches against trunk.

### Upstack / Downstack
- **Downstack**: Ancestors between your current branch and trunk.
- **Upstack**: Descendants stacked on top of your current branch.

### Metadata Cache
Polarity keeps metadata in Git refs (`refs/branch-metadata/*`) along with local files like `.graphite_repo_config`. This cache tracks branch relationships, PR numbers, and state. Many commands load and persist this cache; it is safe to rebuild with `pt repo init` if it becomes inconsistent.

### PR Integration
Polarity syncs PR data with GitHub via the `gh` CLI and Supabase. Commands like `pt submit`, `pt merge`, and `pt add` rely on PR association metadata stored for each branch.

---

## Quick Start Workflow
The following sequence illustrates a common daily flow for a developer adopting Polarity:

1. **Initialize repository** (once per repo):

   ```bash
   pt init
   ```

2. **Make some unittests**:

   ```bash
   pt unittest
   ```

3. **Create a branch and commit with AI**:

   ```bash
   pr c --ai
   ```

4. **Push your changes and make a PR with AI**:

   ```bash
   pt ss --ai
   ```

6. **Sync with latest trunk & clean up (once merged)**:

   ```bash
   pt sync
   ```

7. **Merge via automation**:

   After approvals, use:

   ```bash
   pt merge
   ```

   This merges all PRs from trunk up to the current branch sequentially.

8. **If you break something**:

   ```bash
   pt rewind       # stash and reset if you need a clean tree
   pt unrewind     # recover stashed work if needed
   ```

### `pt help`
- **Usage**: `pt help` or `pt help <command>`
- **Purpose**: Display the custom Polarity help page with definitions, workflow guides, and resource links.
- **Tips**: Use `pt --help --all` to list every available command registered with yargs.

### `pt init`
- **Usage**: `pt init`
- **Purpose**: Initialize a new repository for Polarity. Equivalent to `pt repo init` but accessible at the root.
- **Actions**:
  - Detect trunk branch.
  - Generate `.graphite_repo_config` if missing.
  - Reset cache files when necessary.

### `pt create`
- **Usage**: `pt create [name] [flags]`
- **Key Flags**: `-m/--message`, `--ai`, `--no-ai`, `-a/--all`, `-u/--update`, `-p/--patch`, `-i/--insert`.
- **Purpose**: Create a new branch stacked on the current branch and create or amend a commit in one step.
- **Workflow**:
  1. Optionally stage changes (automatic with `--all` or `--update`).
  2. Prompt for commit message or use provided/AI-generated message.
  3. Create a new branch with the chosen name (auto-generated if omitted and AI is enabled).

### `pt modify`
- **Usage**: `pt modify [flags]`
- **Key Flags**: `--commit`, `--amend`, `--ai`, `--no-ai`, `-a/--all`, `-p/--patch`, `-u/--update`, `-m/--message`.
- **Purpose**: Amend the current branch’s latest commit or create a new commit, optionally restacking descendants.
- **Notes**: Often used mid-stack when you need to adjust an earlier branch without abandoning the stack.

### `pt submit`
- **Usage**: `pt submit [flags]`
- **Key Flags**: `--stack`, `--downstack`, `--draft`, `--publish`, `--ai`, `--no-ai`, `--dry-run`, `--select`, `--update-only`, `--force`.
- **Purpose**: Push branches to remote and create/update GitHub PRs.
- **Behaviour**:
  - Defaults to submitting the current branch and its upstack (`SCOPE.UPSTACK`).
  - `--stack` includes both ancestors and descendants.
  - Optional AI assistance fills in titles and descriptions for branches without PRs.
  - Validates branch state (no uncommitted changes, no merged branches) before running.

### `pt merge`
- **Usage**: `pt merge [--dry-run]`
- **Purpose**: Merge PRs from trunk up to the current branch sequentially.
- **Details**:
  - Refreshes PR metadata before merging.
  - Retargets base branches to trunk if needed.
  - Uses `gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch --yes` for each PR.
  - Supports `--dry-run` to preview actions without merging.

### `pt restack`
- **Usage**: `pt restack [--branch <name>] [--upstack] [--downstack] [--only]`
- **Purpose**: Rebase branches so each branch contains its parent’s commits.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Running `pt restack` after trunk changes ensures stacks replay cleanly.
  - `--upstack` restacks current branch and descendants; `--downstack` restacks ancestors.

### `pt sync`
- **Usage**: `pt sync [flags]`
- **Key Flags**: `--restack`, `--no-pull`, `--no-delete`, `--show-delete-progress`, `--force`.
- **Purpose**: Pull trunk, restack stacks, optionally delete merged branches, and tidy metadata.
- **Typical Flow**: Used daily or after code review merges to ensure local state matches remote.

### `pt checkout`
- **Usage**: `pt checkout [branch] [--stack] [--trunk]`
- **Purpose**: Switch branches interactively or explicitly. Shows a fuzzy list if no branch is provided, with metadata context.

### `pt log`
- **Usage**: `pt log`, `pt log short`, `pt log long`
- **Purpose**: Visualize stacks and branch relationships. `log` default shows structured stack view, `log short` prints condensed summary, `log long` displays commit graph.
- **Flags**: `--stack`, `--reverse`, `--steps`, `--show-untracked` provide granular control.

### `pt info`
- **Usage**: `pt info [branch] [--patch] [--diff] [--body] [--stat]`
- **Purpose**: Display branch metadata, parent/child relationships, PR status, and optionally a diff/patch summary.

### `pt up`, `pt down`, `pt top`, `pt bottom`
- **Usage**: `pt up [steps]`, `pt down [steps]`, `pt top`, `pt bottom`
- **Purpose**: Navigate the stack quickly.
  - `up`: Move to child branches.
  - `down`: Move to parent branches.
  - `top`: Jump to top-most branch in current stack.
  - `bottom`: Jump to bottom-most branch above trunk.

### `pt undo`
- **Usage**: `pt undo [--force]`
- **Purpose**: Perform a hard reset to the last known good state (tracked via cache). Useful after a mis-executed command. `--force` bypasses prompts.

### `pt rewind` & `pt unrewind`
- **Usage**: `pt rewind`, `pt unrewind`
- **Purpose**:
  - `pt rewind`: Stash all changes (including untracked files) with a `polarity-rewind` label and reset working tree to HEAD.
  - `pt unrewind`: Restore the most recent rewind stash, reapplying tracked and untracked files.
- **Notes**: Great for quickly cleaning your worktree without losing progress.

### `pt optimize`
- **Usage**: `pt optimize`
- **Purpose**: Create and push an empty commit ("Polarity PR optimization request") on the current branch to trigger automation (e.g., CI reruns) on the associated PR.
- **Prerequisites**: Clean working tree, branch tracked by Polarity, PR number associated.

### `pt add`
- **Usage**: `pt add`
- **Purpose**: Push metadata about the current GitHub repository into Supabase for monitoring. Requires Polarity authentication.

### `pt merge`
Already covered under root commands.

### `pt shove`
- **Usage**: `pt shove [-m <message>]`
- **Purpose**: Stage all changes, create a commit (AI-assisted if desired), and push upstream in one command. Handy for quick single-branch iteration.

### `pt continue`
- **Usage**: `pt continue`
- **Purpose**: Resume the last Polarity operation that was interrupted by a conflict (restack, submit, sync, etc.). Detects state from `.graphite_continue` metadata.

### `pt demo`
- **Usage**: `pt demo`
- **Purpose**: Spin up a temporary demo repository showcasing Polarity features. Good for onboarding and workshops.

### `pt info`, `pt log`
Already covered above, but note they accept many flags to wire deeper introspection.

### `pt auth`
- **Usage**: `pt auth <command>` (see namespace section)
- **Purpose**: Manage GitHub/Polarity authentication.

### `pt repo`
- **Usage**: `pt repo <command>` (see namespace section)
- **Purpose**: Configure repository-level settings (trunk, remote, owner, etc.).

### `pt commit`
- **Usage**: `pt commit <command>` (see namespace section)
- **Purpose**: Low-level commit operations inside Polarity context (create, amend).

### `pt branch`
- **Usage**: `pt branch <command>` (see namespace section)
- **Purpose**: Operate on branch-specific tasks (track, rename, restack, squash, etc.).

### `pt stack`, `pt upstack`, `pt downstack`
- **Usage**: Provide stack-scoped commands (see next section).

### `pt feedback`
- **Usage**: `pt feedback <command>`
- **Purpose**: Send feedback, logs, or debug info to the Polarity team. Supports subcommands like `pt feedback send`, `pt feedback debug-context`.

### `pt user`
- **Usage**: `pt user <command>`
- **Purpose**: Manage user-level preferences (aliases, branch prefixes, tips, editor/pager overrides).

### `pt completion` / `pt fish`
- **Usage**: `pt completion`, `pt fish`
- **Purpose**: Output shell completion scripts (bash/zsh) or fish shell integration.

### `pt unittest`
- **Usage**: `pt unittest`
- **Purpose**: Runs Polarity test harness (used internally or for integration tests).

### `pt dev`
- **Usage**: `pt dev <command>`
- **Purpose**: Developer utilities (viewing cache, metadata) primarily for Polarity CLI contributors.

### `pt internal-only-*`
These commands are for internal debugging and not part of public workflows. They are namespaced under `internal-only-commands`.

## Frequently Asked Questions
**Q: Do I have to use stacks?**  
A: Polarity is designed around stacked development, but you can still use it for single-branch workflows. Commands like `pt create` and `pt submit` offer value even on isolated branches.

**Q: What if I already have branches on GitHub?**  
A: Use `pt branch track <branch>` to attach Polarity metadata to existing branches. Then run `pt submit --update-only` to sync PR info.

**Q: Can I disable AI globally?**  
A: Yes. Export `POLARITY_DISABLE_AI=1` or always pass `--no-ai`. Without credentials the CLI works normally but without AI suggestions.

**Q: What’s the difference between `pt restack` and `pt sync --restack`?**  
A: `pt restack` focuses on rebasing branches, while `pt sync` also pulls trunk, deletes merged branches (optional), and updates metadata.

**Q: How do I clean up merged branches?**  
A: Run `pt sync --restack` for automated cleanup, or manually delete branches with `pt branch delete <name>` with `--force` if needed.

**Q: When should I use `pt merge` vs. GitHub UI?**  
A: `pt merge` is ideal when you want to land an entire stack sequentially without leaving the terminal. It ensures bases are correct and cleans up branches afterward.

**Q: Can I recover from a failed submit/merge mid-operation?**  
A: Yes. Resolve conflicts, then run `pt continue`. If all else fails, use `pt undo` or `pt rewind` and try again.
