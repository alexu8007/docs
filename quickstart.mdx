## Getting Started

<Steps>

<Step title="Connect Your Repository" icon="folder-git">
  Navigate to the **Repositories** page in your dashboard.
  
  - Browse repositories from your connected GitHub organizations
  - Select the repos you want Polarity to monitor
  - Enable tracking for your chosen repositories
  
  <Check>
    Your enabled repos will now appear in the dashboard!
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Select a Pull Request" icon="git-pull-request">
  Go to the **Dashboard** page to see all available PRs.
  
  - View PRs from your enabled repositories
  - Choose the PR you want to refine
  - Review the PR details and changes
</Step>

<Step title="Start the Refinement" icon="play">
  Click the **arrow button** next to your selected PR to begin refinement.
  
  The PR moves to the **Pending** section and the refinement process starts automatically.
</Step>

<Step title="Planner Creates Tasks" icon="list-checks">
  Watch as the AI Planner analyzes your PR and generates refinement tasks.
  
  **What happens:**
  - Planner loads and analyzes code changes
  - Tasks appear in real-time as they're generated
  - Each task targets specific improvements
  
  <Tip>
    This usually takes 10-30 seconds depending on PR size
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Customize the Plan" icon="pencil">
  Interact with the planner to perfect your refinement strategy.
  
  **You can:**
  - **Delete tasks** you don't want executed
  - **Chat with the bot** to add new tasks
  - **Modify existing tasks** for specific needs
  - **Tag files** to focus refinement on certain areas
  - **Adjust priorities** and task order
  
  <Info>
    Take your time here! A well-planned refinement produces better results.
  </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Workers Execute Tasks" icon="robot">
  Once you approve the plan, AI workers spawn and start making edits.
  
  **The process:**
  - Multiple workers execute tasks in parallel
  - Each worker focuses on specific improvements
  - Real-time progress updates show completion
  - Code changes are applied to your PR
  
  <Check>
    You can monitor worker progress in the dashboard as they complete tasks!
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Paragon Verifies Changes" icon="shield-check">
  Paragon, our verification agent, thoroughly tests all changes for quality and reliability.
  
  **Verification process (all autonomous)**
  - **Opens a sandbox environment** for isolated testing
  - **Runs all unit tests** to ensure functionality
  - **Executes end-to-end (e2e) tests** for integration validation
  - **Tests all API endpoints** to verify service reliability
  - **Checks code quality** and syntax
  - **Validates logic consistency** and best practices
  
  <Warning>
    If any tests fail or issues are detected, Paragon automatically requests worker revisions until all checks pass
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Review & Merge" icon="check-circle">
  Your refined PR is ready! Review the improvements and merge.
  
  
  <Check>
    Congratulations! You've completed your first refinement! 🎉
  </Check>
</Step>

## Understanding the Process

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Planner Phase" icon="brain">
    The Planner analyzes your PR and creates a strategic refinement plan. It identifies areas for improvement like code quality, performance, testing, and documentation. You have full control to modify this plan before execution.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Worker Phase" icon="users">
    AI Workers execute the approved tasks in parallel. Each worker specializes in specific improvements and works independently to apply changes to your code. Progress is tracked in real-time as tasks complete.
  </Accordion>
  
<Accordion title="Verification Phase" icon="check">
    Paragon verifies all changes meet quality standards by opening a sandbox environment and running comprehensive tests. This includes all unit tests, end-to-end tests, API endpoint validation, syntax checks, logic consistency, and best practices compliance. Failed checks trigger automatic worker revisions until everything passes.
